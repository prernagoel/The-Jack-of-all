Hi there! I'm Prerna. Iâ€™m a Biology major, Data science minor student at IISER Mohali. Ever since I first learned how to program, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. I'm a person curious about most stuff and always looking forward to new experiences and adventures in life. I love trekking, yoga, piano, dancing, football, poetry, meeting new people and talking about life and tech. And just to be clear, when I say I love to do these things, it in no way translates to 'I'm good at this stuff.' 
I'm creating this website to share my thoughts/stories/learnings through blog posts and connect with more people. 
Would love to talk or hear any thoughts or suggestions. Feel free to connect over any medium.

May the force be with you! :)

P.S. - I love Star Wars, Marvel, Harry Potter and Gangs of Wasseypur. :p
