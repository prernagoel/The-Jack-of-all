Hi there! Welcome to my blog. I’m a Data Science Associate Consultant, and for the past three years, I’ve been on an incredible journey working on some amazing projects at ZS Associates, Gurgaon. From machine learning to generative AI, I’ve had the chance to dive into some really cool algorithms. I have a Masters of Science from IISER Mohali with Specialization in Data Science and Biology.

During my time at ZS, I’ve gotten a chance to directly work with stakeholders from Fortune 100 Pharma companies and also developed some really cool products along the way. Each one has taught me something new and fueled my love for using data to solve problems and spark innovation.

I’m a big believer in sharing what I’ve learned, which is why I started this blog. Here, I’ll share stories from my professional and personal experiences and the lessons I’ve picked up along the way and hope to connect with more people. Whether you’re into data science or just curious about it, I hope you’ll find something interesting and useful in my posts.

Thanks for stopping by! Would love to talk or hear any thoughts or suggestions. Feel free to connect over any medium.
