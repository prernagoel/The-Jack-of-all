## 1. Adjective that I think define me 
Fun-loving, talkative, little funny (I repeat 'little'), enthusiastic, independence lover,hard-working, a very open person to have all sorts of conversations with and currently somewhere in between the continuum from ambivert to extrovert.

## 2. The Confident bitch
I was never the confident person I am today. I used to be shy, gawky, awkward and a little scared of what people are thinking about me. I think I am one of those people who took the exact energy with which I used to hate myself and turned it into confidence. The things that we think the people are thinking are actually the thoughts just in our head about our own self. So, I just tried to change my own self to become a better version of me. Now one can say if it were so easy, every other person would do it and become the so-called better version of them. But essentially, it's not that easy but just requires the right approach and determination. For me, two things worked. One, to exactly go and do the thing which I am scared to do but deep inside really want to do. For instance, my introvertness. I never wanted to be an introvert, rather I want to be just the opposite. I want to be the kind of person who talks to everybody and is very friendly. But the only problem was that I never knew how to really converse well. I tried to look at what all my friends talk about with random or atleast not so close people. I talked to many people over chats. Essentially, I realised that there is a pattern to everything. It's just the different versions of those same old topics plus a little confidence and self-touch mixed up that results into good and at times productive conversations. A golden thing I learnt was that being honest and funny is the key coz if one doesn't work, you can always lean on the other. Also, no matter how nice or sweet or introvert or extrovert you are, someone will always call you a bitch. So, why not be a sassy and confident one!

## 3. The independence worm
