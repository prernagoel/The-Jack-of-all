### Keys to the Updated Version
- **Learnt to be extrovert:** I am not inherently introvert and wanted to be a friendly person. I never really knew how to converse well or so I thought. I looked at what my social friends talk about with most people. I realised that it's just the same old topics plus a little self-touch mixed up that leads to engaging & productive conversations. It required work in the start but became seamless with time. 
- **Professional Validation:** My work life at ZS also gave me a confidence booster. I was good at my work and was hired in the first ever interview I gave. I thought to myself, if stakeholders from a billion dollar firm think you're worth it, then you better believe you're worth it! 
- **Honesty and sarcasm:** Another golden thing I learnt was that being honest and funny is the key coz if one doesn't work, you can always lean on the other. Also, no matter how nice or sweet or introvert or extrovert you are, someone will always call you a bitch. So, why not be a sassy and confident one!  

### Hobbies/Interests
- Singing - I'm learning and I love it. Created an IG page with my boyfriend. Feel free to give a visit - add link 
- Reading - Read few fiction and non-fiction books. Alamanacks of Naval Ravikant & Atomic Habits are some of the favs.
- Writing - Thinking about writing blogs and a book since forever. Hopefully I do it soon
- Data Science - I'm a data scientist by profession. I like the job for most part of it. Feel free to explore my linkedIn or Github page. 
- Talking - I like talking to people. So much that I thought, how could one earn by talking so that I can do what I love. Logic. Answer was Podcast. Hopefully soon. 
- Fitness - I like being fit. I love sweets. Its the toughest task to stay fit but I try.  
- Travel - Not wanting to visit every country in the world or even 50 countries. But would love to travel on a quarterly frequency to another state/country and just experience life.

**Note** - I firmly believe in the 'Fake it till you make it' philosophy, especially in personal growth and self-improvement opportunities because it works!
