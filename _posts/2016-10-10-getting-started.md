# Creative is relative

Motivational addresses are not a thing for everyone, at least not until they sound a little extraordinary. The old 'Don't run after success, run after excellence' stuff was once a treat for the ears but now it sounds like the rest of the crap that people tell you. Basically, these quotes are indirect loop holes. Why not be just direct in what you want to convey and make it a little productive for the person who's listening as well. 

I've heard multiple times in life that artists are creative, that some filmmakers are creative or the random person you know is creative and all these times, the meaning of the adjective 'creative' that my mind would comprehend and assign them was of being original, of creating things, thoughts or ideas by themselves. The second immediate thought was the deduction that I'm not creative ; until recently. It took me a while to realise that there are very few things in life that are in science terms, de-novo. What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere. All creative work builds on what came before. 

So, the idea I'm pitching here is that your creativity is the some total of the conversations you're having with people, the books, articles, etc. that you are reading or any art/piece of work you've been sliding across your face. However, how good or bad is your creativity will be decided by how much of the same things the society is doing in the same time era. An idea that was creative 100 years ago will most probably not be creative today. A painter who spends his and night in paintings, looking at them, analysing them, understanding the best artists will definitely be more creative painter than a paint-once-a-year-when-really-bored kind of painter like me. So, to simple put it the goal is to steal the idea that you like the most and mould it, change it, redesign it, the same way I'm doing with this post. But bro, give reference! That's what science taught me after all.

So to end with how the French writer André Gide put it, “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.

P.S. - I mostly don't like this preaching/motivational stuff but more than preaching it's just to convey the happiness and confidence I felt on realising the idea that we all are creative relatively after all and essentially, I can be as creative as I want to be!
